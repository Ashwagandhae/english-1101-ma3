<h1>Atlanta Food Insecurity</h1>
<p>
	As a kid, I used to love to go grocery shopping. I enjoyed looking at all of the unique foods and
	loved helping my parents choose what to make for dinner. I never once went to bed hungry. The same
	can not be said for many other kids in Atlanta. According to the Atlanta Community Food Bank, in
	Georgia, 18.4% of children face food insecurity, a disproportionate number of which are black or
	latino (1). Additionally, 68% of these people have household incomes above the federal poverty
	line, limiting their eligibility to federal assistance programs, such as SNAP (1). This is a true
	crisis: no child, or any person for that matter, should ever have to go hungry. Frustratingly,
	this hunger does not arise from a lack of available food. 40% of all food produced each year is
	never eaten, a staggering amount of waste that could much better serve the community (2). In fact,
	in the Atlanta area alone, 125,000 tons of food is discarded annually (2)â€“think about that, tons!
	From households to bakeries to the grocery stores I loved going to as a kid, perfectly good
	surplus food is tossed each and every day. With this much food headed to landfills instead of
	stomachs, I knew that there had to be some way I could help fight this crisis.
