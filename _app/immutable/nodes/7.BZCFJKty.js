	Volunteering at the ACFB is easy yet rewarding. As a volunteer, you can help organize and sort
	food items, create packages for families in need, or simply help spread the word about the ACFB
	and its purpose. Signing up is as simple as going to <a href="https://www.acfb.org/volunteer/">this website</a>, selecting an opportunity, and registering your information. There are dozens of opportunities,
	meaning that volunteering can work directly in conjunction with your schedule. No experience is
	needed: tasks are simple and intuitive while remaining engaging, as you directly contribute to
	addressing hunger for thousands of people. Additionally, you can organize a food drive at your
	local school or organization and contribute food directly to the ACFB, saving food from being
	thrown away and giving it new purpose to those who need it most. If you donâ€™t have the time to
	spare or ability to contribute directly, you can still help. The Atlanta Community Food Bank <a href="https://www.acfb.org/donate/">needs donations</a> to continue its mission; even one dollar
	can provide enough food for up to three meals.</p>`,1);function p(o){var e=i();a(2),t(o,e)}export{p as component};
