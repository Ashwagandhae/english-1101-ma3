	29 counties in Georgia (3). It has grown to be the biggest food bank in the southeast since its
	beginning in 1979 (3). The food bank stands to fight hungry people by providing nutritious food
	and resources for thousands of individuals and families. Serving millions of pounds of food a
	year, the local farmers, grocery stores, and donors all help to make it a place to help people.
	These millions of pounds of food are turned into approximately 84 million meals a year (3). At the
	core of the Atlanta community food bank, it is made with the belief that access to good nutritious
	food is a human right and its efforts reflect that. The food bank also helps communities break out
	of poverty by offering job training and food stamp enrollment. The food bank isn't only a place to
	give food, it helps the community in many different ways.</p>`,1);function l(o){var t=i();n(2),e(o,t)}export{l as component};
