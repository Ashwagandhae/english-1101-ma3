	for the citizens of Atlanta by providing food to those in need of food. One important measurement
	that can be used to determine Atlanta Food Bank’s efficacy is the amount of meals they distribute.
	Atlanta Food Bank excels in this particular regard, having distributed more than 113 million meals
	to people in need in just one fiscal year (ending in June 30, 2024) (3). Distributing 113 million
	meals in 365 days means that the Atlanta Food Bank distributed, on average, more than 300,000 per
	day, putting a significant dent in the hunger of the 715,000 people that are projected to be food
	insecure. Another important metric to determine the success of Atlanta Food Bank’s approach is the
	efficiency with which the organization uses donated money to provide food. More specifically,
	understanding the amount of money spent per meal distributed can help potential donors understand
	whether their money is being put to good use. Atlanta Food Bank also excels in this area, spending
	just 1-3 dollars per meal (3). This exceeding efficiency in fund usage makes Atlanta Food Bank an
	effective investment for donors or volunteers who want to efficiently make a significant impact.
	Finally, another important factor to take into account when measuring the usefulness of Atlanta
	Food Bank is its connections with local community organizations. Connecting with local
	organizations shows Atlanta Food Bank’s ability to build trust with the community and its ability
	to leverage pre existing infrastructure to achieve its goals efficiently. Atlanta Food Bank also
	triumphs in this avenue, working with almost 700 community-based partners (3), which gives donors
	and volunteers the confidence that their donations and efforts are being put to good use.</p><!----><!----></div></main><!----><!--]--> <!--[!--><!--]--><!--]-->
